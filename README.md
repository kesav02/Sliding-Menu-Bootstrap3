Sliding-Menu-Bootstrap3
=======================

Facebook like sliding menu with bootstrap 3.0.
I created this menu based on the work done by Dwayne Forde using bootstrap 2.x

See http://pivotallabs.com/html5-facebook-style-sliding-menu-using-twitter-bootstrap-collapse/

The main change I had to do is to add some css for the the class collapsing that seems to be used with bootstrap 3.x 

See on http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/

" ...
.collapsing is added when the transition starts, and removed when it finishes
..."
